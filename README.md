# MNIST
I'm learning about ML so this is my hello world of ANNs. 
This python script demonstrates the modeling of a tensorflow neural net,  
as well as the ability to save weights once per epoch during training, 
loading in pre saved weights to a new identical model, 
and even testing accuracy with custom generated digits that I drew in ms paint.
